# Fabric Playground

A sandboxy place for people to come and play with procedural drawing.

Currently favors full on fabricjs package over react-fabric cuz I wanna learn straight up fabric.

Uses a silly/stupid simple pattern of simply creating regular ol' namespaced js fns that get imported into App.js root and run at proper times when elements are available.

Go forth and make a mess of things...
